Yey! My polyglot talk for NDC London got accepted so it looks like I'll be in London in December for the second year in a row. The talk will be a compressed version of the [CQRS blog serie](http://blog.tomasjansson.com/tag/cqrsshop/) I wrote earlier this year. The title of the talk is "Polyglot heaven - how to build a async, reactive application in 2014". As you realize from the title the focus is on polyglot rather than CQRS and picking the right tools for the right job. There is a lot of things that I'll cover in the talk like, CQRS, event sourcing, [Event Store](http://geteventstore.com), [Neo4j](http://www.neo4j.org/) (graph database), [Elastichsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) (search database) and I'll do programming in both F# and C#. I'm not sure how I'll fit it into one hour, but that is my goal.
